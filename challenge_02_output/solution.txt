You tell Tinface the solution. She nods, and smiles very, very slightly. You’re not sure she did smile. It might just have been a trick of the light.

Once more, Tinface reaches below her table and places something in front of you. It’s a handheld radio – a compact, unworn, much sought-after model that would make all your friends from home jealous, especially considering how much radio’s taken off these past few months. Tinface switches it on, and you turn the dial around, listening alternately to static and Onia’s new music station.

You understand that you are to take the radio, and after thanking Tinface for such a generous gift, you pack it in your rucksack and head out of the marketplace.
